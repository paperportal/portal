# Paper Portal Runner

This project is the firmware for Paper Portal. It runs an embedded launcher
webassembly program that can then run other webassembly apps from SD card.

Work in progress, not really useful yet.

## Naming conventions (Zig)

Use `lowerCamelCase` for all functions, except functions that return a type (Zig), which use `PascalCase`.
